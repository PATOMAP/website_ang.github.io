       <h2>Faster and more flexible digital printing with reduced press proof waste</h2>

       <p>Refine Finishing, a Danish machine builder, has become a leading global supplier of machines that convert digitally printed labels. 
        The company, equipped with PC-based control from Beckhoff, has developed machines that set new standards in terms of speed, precision, 
        and sustainability. Refine Finishing's machines, utilizing 
        TwinCAT Vision and TwinCAT IoT, allow for the production of even the smallest batches of multilayer labels on demand.</p>

       <p>Refine Finishing, formerly known as Werosys, was established in 2013 and now has Nilpeter as its majority shareholder.
         Over 95% of its machines are exported, primarily to customers in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries. 
        The company's focus is on reducing printing and finishing costs, as well as minimizing paper waste through press proofing.</p>

       <p>The printing industry is currently undergoing a significant transformation, 
        with a demand for profitable, high-quality, and timely production of small and short-run orders. 
        Customized production that can adapt to short notice orders is made possible through increased software integration and automation.
        This approach reduces the need for extensive storage capacity and eliminates lengthy planning processes.</p>

       <p>Refine Finishing's machines offer numerous benefits due to their high software functionality. 
        The machines feature built-in vision technology and are designed to optimize workflow with the latest technology, speed, and precision.
         Customers can now divide large label orders into smaller portions and plan a few weeks ahead, resulting in reduced delivery times. 
        The machines also minimize paper waste during proofing, contributing to resource-saving label production.</p>

       <p>The control system of Refine Finishing's machines automates manual settings, 
        eliminating user errors and creating a more uniform process. 
        Remote access and real-time monitoring via digitization enable control and assistance from anywhere, 
        offering significant value, particularly in the COVID-19 era.</p>

       <p>The core functionality of the machines is provided by TwinCAT Vision and TwinCAT IoT. 
        The control system uses a GigE vision camera integrated seamlessly through 
        TwinCAT Vision to ensure accurate positioning of individual sheets in multilayer labels. 
        PC-based control and object-oriented programming facilitate job management and data integration with Microsoft Azure via TwinCAT IoT. 
        The collaboration with Beckhoff has been crucial to Refine Finishing's success, 
        with PC-based control offering accuracy, high-speed capabilities, and flexibility to tailor machines to customer needs.</p>

       <p>The range of components available for PC-based control from Beckhoff, including 
        the C6017 ultra-compact Industrial PC, EtherCAT Terminals, EL7031-0030 stepper motor terminals, and AX5000 and AX8000 Servo Drives, 
        provides additional advantages. The integration of machine safety through 
        TwinSAFE into the standard control technology is also a notable feature.</p>

       <p>Refine Finishing values its partnership with Beckhoff, as it aligns with the company's vision of developing machines based on intelligent software and IoT. 
        The collaboration allows for quick integration of new products and protocols into the modular machines, offering flexibility and future readiness.</p>
